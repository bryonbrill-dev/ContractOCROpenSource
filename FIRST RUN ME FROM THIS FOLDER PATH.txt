RUN THE BELOW COMMAND FIRST!:

cd C:\ContractsOCR\Workarea
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload

THEN RUN AND INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES BELOW:

pip install -r requirements.txt


THEN VERIFY THE PATHS IN APP.PY are correct!:


DB_PATH = os.environ.get(
    "CONTRACT_DB",
    r"C:\ContractsOCR\data\contracts.db"
)

DATA_ROOT = os.environ.get(
    "CONTRACT_DATA",
    r"C:\ContractsOCR\data\originals"
)

WHILE BEING INSIDE OF THE (.venv) Activated environment Chosen run the below:

uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload


To confirm the API is online visit: http://localhost:8080/docs

Also to confirm API fetching perform locally in powershell: get http://localhost:8080/api/events?month=2025-12


Health Checks can be done here: http://localhost:8080/api/notifications  you will see [] and nothing else.

Sanity CHECKS can be done this way with a contract_id call to the API: sanity check:

Copy that contract_id

Hit:

GET http://localhost:8080/api/contracts/<contract_id>
OR
CURL http://localhost:8080/api/contracts/<contract_id>
126c46a3-721f-4914-a808-0d66920d3166

Confirm it returns the contract object (terms/events empty for now, which is expected until OCR/extraction is wired in)

Now begin to install the OCR and dependencies for the extraction Pipeline:

::::::Inside of your activated venv command run the below::::::

pip install pytesseract pdf2image pillow python-dateutil pypdf


Checking the possible status values and their importance: 

| Status       | Meaning                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `processing` | File uploaded, OCR/extraction running      |
| `processed`  | OCR/extraction finished successfully       |
| `error`      | OCR or parsing failed                      |
| `uploaded`   | (optional future state) waiting to process |
